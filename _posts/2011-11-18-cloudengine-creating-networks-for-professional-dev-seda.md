## Abstract:

### Session Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, delegates will be able to:

* Understand the aims of the OULDI project, CloudEngine and Cloudworks,
* Understand what functionality CloudEngine offers,
* Understand how CloudEngine may benefit you and your organization,
* Understand how to login to a CloudEngine site, create a cloud and find resources.

### Session Outline

Social and participatory technologies - with their emphasis on sharing and user production -
seem to offer great potential for educators in supporting their professional development and
in sharing best practice; however a recent review of the use of these technologies in an
educational context leads to a bleak conclusion:

> “..even though ‘Web 2.0’ tools seem to have the right mix of affordances to facilitate
sharing and discussion of educational ideas, this is not happening spontaneously across the
broad educational community, nor is it happening at scale where the real macro benefits
of the collective intelligence affordances (Lévy, 1997) and sheer scale of the web comes
into effect” –– Conole (2010)

This paper focuses on an output of the JISC-funded Open University Learning Design Initiative
(<http://ouldi.open.ac.uk>) which aims to address this mismatch: ‘CloudEngine’
(<http://getcloudengine.org>), social web software, centred on social objects – Clouds and
Cloudscapes.
