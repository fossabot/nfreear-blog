A week ago today I stood up and talked about my personal experiences as a
person who stammers, and the valuable work of the [British Stammering Association][].
The occasion was the weekly Monday evening meal of the
[Rotary Club of Leighton-Linslade][rot], to which I had been invited as guest speaker.
The Club made me very welcome, and proved to be a good audience for my talk,
laughing in the right places and asking some pertinent questions
("_What's the difference between a stammer and a stutter?_" Answer: _none_, woops I meant to mention that in the talk!)

This talk marked the first time I have spoken to a group about this most personal of afflictions, though I have at various points discussed my stammer with individual friends, family, colleagues, and occasionally virtual strangers.

I related the anguish I experienced when asking for a job behind the bar as a school leaver. How I got stuck each time I asked if there was work available, and ended up in tears and unsuccessful.

And I recounted my life-changing experience of group speech therapy at the [QE Hospital][] ([new QE][]),
Birmingham as a 20 year old student.
This intensive 5-6 month therapy followed the [modified Van Riper method][van],
and included steps where I studied a video of myself stammering, I discussed the hidden pain and frustration I felt with my stammer, and where I practiced voluntary stammering with complete strangers.
(_Yes, stammering on purpose is scary.
It's one of many things some of the 375,000 people in Britain and the millions around the world try._)
The therapy allowed me to finally start accepting and understanding my condition.

I found the experience of giving this talk self-affirming, and the feedback
from the audience was that they found it useful and interesting.
I hope to give more similar talks soon.

## My top 10 dos and don'ts if you should meet someone who stammers

1. Don't panic! I know it looks a bit off-putting/weird.
2. Don't "_ignore_"/ look at the person next to me,
3. Don't guess or try to finish my sentence, please,
4. Don't interrupt - I may be about to come out of a block,
5. Don't say "_relax_", "_take a deep breath_" etc.,
6. Do appear patient, - even if there is a queue of customers behind me,
7. Do say "_it's OK_",
8. Maintain eye-contact,
9. Perhaps try to help, after a while - if it looks like I'm tiring!
(_Some people with stammers may not take kindly to this, no matter how tired they look!_)
10. Ask/ talk! – teachers may like to ask children who stammer how they can help,
but you should accept that young people (and older people) may not be comfortable acknowledging their stammer.
