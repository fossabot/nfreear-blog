## Synopsis

The project was selected because it involved product design in the field of
Applied Gerontology; the study of the interaction between older people and the
man-made eniro[n]ment.
Many older people sufer from minor impairments [to arthritis]
which affect their mobility, (such as arthritis) and the aim of the project was
to  design household objects.
The chosen devices were the EasiRiser, which assists the user out of their seat;
and the EasiSpray, to make operating aerosol cans easier.
A postal survey was performed to collect data, then statistical methods were
used to draw conclusions.
Finally the EasiRiser was detail designed, and a prototype was produced.
