## Abstract

In an increasingly globalised business environment, the behaviour and performance
of managers from one country and culture working in another has never been more relevant.
Of particular interest is the behaviour of expatriate managers from the west,
working in Asian-owned or joint-venture companies situated in East Asia, and
making decisions individually and as a group.
The current study differs from many that are based around questionnaires and a quantitative methodology.
It is a qualitative investigation into expatriate French managers based in
China, and working in Chinese and French-Chinese companies.
The choice of French managers situated in China is based on the distinct
differences in culture, and the author’s own background as a Chinese manager
working with French colleagues.
The familiarity of the author with both the Chinese and French business cultures
is important for useful interpretation of the data.
The understanding of both cultures used in creating the methodology, interviewing,
analysing and interpreting the data is an important and distinctive aspect of the research.
The research looks at the manager's choice of individual or group decision-making styles,
and the factors that influence the manager's choices in different cultural contexts.
It uses cognitive mapping techniques to analyse 20 interview transcripts.
The study concluded that cognitive mapping is a viable methodology to gain
insights into the manager's individual and group decision-making styles.
This methodology provided an opportunity to follow the manager's thinking around
the choices they made, and to identify the factors that influence the
manager's decision-making styles and process.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to acknowledge the support of my research supervisors: Anne Smith, Howard Viney and Tim Ray.
I owe a particular debt of gratitude to my original principal supervisor
Geoff Mallory who sadly passed away in February 2012.
It was Geoff who provided me with the original support and encouragement,
and saw the early promise of my ideas and research.

I would also like to thank Monica Dowling, who stepped in as one of my
supervisors for a time and likewise provided much needed help and advice.

I thank and acknowledge my anonymous interviewees and their employees.
Obviously, without their generous time and energy, there would have been no research.

And finally, thank you to my husband and my best friend, Nick for his support and
help; and my daughter, Rosie, for her patience and for bringing more happiness into my life.
