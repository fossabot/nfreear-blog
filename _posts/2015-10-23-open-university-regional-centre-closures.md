The news that the Open University plans to close seven out of its thirteen
regional centres in England made the national media.
In the wake of this, various Open University staff have written some insightful
pieces on what goes on at the regional centres.

They opened my eyes.

I would challenge the Vice-Chancellor's Executive, and other senior management
to visit regional centres and talk to students, tutors and other staff.
If, after they've done that, they can still look students and staff in the eyes
and honestly say the centres are not useful, perhaps they'll receive a bit more support.
