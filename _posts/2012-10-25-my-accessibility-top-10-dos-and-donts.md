Quoting from a recent blog post by [Marco Zehe][marco],

Like Marco, I'm a little dismayed by what the discussions on Twitter and his blog seem to reveal.

And, to quote from [Molily’s comment][molily],

> The majority does not consider accessibility as a crucial part of HTML5 (as an umbrella term).
> People are building huge apps and interactive experiences with HTML5.
> Accessibility isn’t necessarily a built-in feature.
> When people talk about HTML5, accessibility isn’t naturally included.

Quoting from [And’s comment][ands],

> So what are the top 5 or 10 pragmatic dos and don’ts?

I'm always one for a challenge, so here are my top 10 dos and don'ts:


1. Do install/ experiment with some tools and techniques -- [NVDA screen reader][nvda] on Windows;
  [VoiceOver][] on Mac OS X; [Windows high contrast][win]; navigating with the keyboard (TAB, shift+TAB);
  the [HTML CodeSniffer][cs] -- but don't expect validator/lint tools to find all the problems,
2. Don't take HTML(5) markup for granted -- whether you're generating it via Javascript in a big Web application, or directly on a small Web site.
  Use of headings `<h1>`, form labels `<label>`, `<button>` … is important,
3. Do markup things like buttons, well.. as buttons!
  Either directly `<button title="Play video"></button>` (ideal)
  OR `<img role=button tabindex=0 title="Play video" />` (a [WAI-ARIA][] hack),
4. Don't assume that just because you are using a framework/ library/ whatever, then you have accessibility covered. There are some examples of active accessibility/usability movements within development communities, eg. [Drupal UI standards][drupal], [Drupal group][], but there are plenty that need help,
5. However, do use abstractions, for example a form library; oEmbed or `<iframe>`s for embedding… --
  this way accessibility/ usability bugs can (hopefully) be fixed in many places simultaneously,
6. Do think about the process - require accessibility and usability standards in specifications/ tenders, build in training, build in testing, build in bug fixing [BS 8878][],
7. Do use standards -- they aren't always scary, and [WCAG 2.0][] has a "top four" --
  _perceivable, operable, understandable, robust ([POUR][])_ --
  An example of perceivable would be adding the `title` attribute to the previous `<button>` example;
  an example of operable would be adding `role` and `tabindex` to the WAI-ARIA hack above… --
  be aware that while standards and technologies change, general principles don't,
8. Do talk about what you're doing -- not to show off, but to raise awareness;
  do contribute to the community -- fixing problems, testing, encouraging…,
9. Do read, attend courses -- [EHRC course][ehrc], [H807 on OpenLearn][H807],
  [H810 at The OU][H810], [Web Platform Docs][web], [Dive into Accessibility][dive], [search][]…,
10. Do take small steps, make small improvements -- even if accessibility isn't built in from the start there is usually something that can improve the experience of end-users.


I'm aware that the above list mixes big picture and nitty-gritty points, and possible

Plenty of [other][] [people][] have their [own][] [takes][] on this.

What is your top tip?
