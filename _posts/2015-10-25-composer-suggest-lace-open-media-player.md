Over the course of a number of recent development phases in different software projects,
I've been working to simplify installation and dependency management, while leaving room
for the sort of experimentation required in research projects (indeed, many software projects?)

Way back in November 2013, I was working for [Gill Clough][] on the
[Tricky Topic tool][ttt], for the [JuxtaLearn][] European funded project.
Initial work for the tool was done by Martin Hawksey, and built on WordPress.
When I took over, I decided to use [Git submodules][] to manage the dependencies on
WordPress, third-party plugins, and custom plugins being developed for the project.

You can [see what this looks like on GitHub][github-1] in the first screen-shot ...

Some potential benefits to note about Git submodules -- you can see the dependencies,
and their Git SHA-1 sums directly in GitHub, as the above screen shot shows.
However, as anyone who has tried submodules tends to realise, their are a [number][]
of [drawbacks][d].

There are [alternatives][alt], built to work fairly closely with Git.
However, these would all require evaluation, and would probably prove difficult
to support in our small, busy team.
So, after some experimentation, I concluded it was safer to adopt the _de facto_
standard dependency-manager for PHP, [Composer][], in my next project.
This was the [LACE Evidence Hub][LACE-EH], for Doug Clow and Rebecca Ferguson.

The LACE Evidence Hub was also built on WordPress, and grew in part out of the work
on the OER Research Hub. Discoveries that helped me decide on Composer were [this 2013 post][],
and the discovery of the [WordPress Packagist][] repository.

The modified use of Composer [suggestions][] involves JSON containing a
package name on the left (eg. `wpackagist-plugin/wp-postratings`), and on the right
a string that starts with a precise version constraint and a semi-colon (`1.82;`),
followed by free text that can optionally contain tags (eg. `postratings`, `[LACE]`...).

Here's a short JSON example:

{% highlight json %}
"suggest": {
    "wpackagist-plugin/wp-postratings": "1.82; postratings [LACE] & [OERRH]"
}
{% endhighlight %}


Here is a [longer example][ex-2]:

{% highlight json linenos %}
"require": {
    "php": ">=5.3.3",
    "fancyguy/webroot-installer": "1.1.0",
    "nfreear/composer-suggest": "^1.1",

    "wordpress/wordpress": "4.1",

    "wpackagist-plugin/google-universal-analytics": "2.4.2",
},
"suggest": {
    "wordpress/wordpress": "4.3; WP-4.3.x",
    "wordpress/wordpress": "4.3.1; WP-4.3.1 / LAC-E only for now!",

    "wpackagist-plugin/facetious": "1.1.4; wp-facet [LAC-E] & [OERR-H] projects",
    "cftp/facetious": "dev-master; cftp-facet-1.2 [LAC-E] project",
    "wpackagist-plugin/wp-postratings": "1.82; postratings [LACE] & [OERRH]"
}
{% endhighlight %}


Some things worth noting:

1. The package `../google-universal-analytics` is always required;
2. Their are two optional WordPress versions, which can override the _default_ version (4.1);
3. Almost all the `suggestions` use a precise version constraint -- this is safer!
