For the past year I've been following the progress of HTML5 with interest.
And recently I've become interested in [MIT's Scratch][]. So naturally I've been
test embedding Scratch using it's Java applet in HTML5.
The [only article][] I've found so far on embedding Scratch in HTML5 contains a
number of errors and invalid markup, so I'm setting the record straight.

<!--more-->

First, the situation in [HTML 4.01][]/XHTML 1.0 – `<object>` is the preferred element, with `<applet>` deprecated.
So, `<applet>` is valid in HTML 4 Loose (XHTML 1.0 Transitional), but not HTML 4 Strict.

Example embed for HTML 4.01:


{% highlight html %}
<applet codebase="http://scratch.mit.edu/static/misc/" archive="ScratchApplet.jar"
        code="ScratchApplet" height="387" width="482">
   <param name="project" value="../../static/projects/technoguyx/355353.sb" >
   Your browser needs Java to view projects.
</applet>
{% endhighlight %}


In HTML5, the [`<applet>` element is obsolete][applet], not deprecated.
So, we use the [generic `<object>` element][object]. Also, we need an alternative to
the archive, code and codebase attributes. It took me a while to work out the solution,
with the help of the [W3C validator][w3c] – we can use the `<param>` element.

Now, the HTML5 code:


{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><meta charset=UTF-8 >

<object tabindex="0" type="application/x-java-applet" height="387" width="482">
  <!--Generic parameters for all Java applets. -->
  <param name="codebase" value="http://scratch.mit.edu/static/misc/" >
  <param name="archive"  value="ScratchApplet.jar" >
  <param name="code"     value="ScratchApplet" >

  <!--Specific parameters. -->
  <param name="project"  value="../../static/projects/technoguyx/355353.sb" >
  Your browser needs Java to view projects.
</object>
...
{% endhighlight %}
