Automated Visual Inspection for the Quality Control of Pad Printing ([e-thesis][])

by Nicholas David Freear

A thesis submitted to The University of Birmingham for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy

Schools of Engineering
The University of Birmingham
December 2001


Supervisor: Dr. James Shippen


## Abstract

Pad printing is used to decorate consumer goods largely because of its unique
ability to apply graphics to doubly curved surfaces. The Intelpadrint project
was conceived to develop a better understanding of the process and new printing
pads, inks and printers. The thesis deals primarily with the research of
a printer control system including machine vision.
At present printing is manually controlled.
Operator knowledge was gathered for use by an expert system to control the process.
A novel local corner-matching algorithm was conceived to effect image segmentation,
and neuro-fuzzy techniques were used to recognise patterns in printing errors.
Non-linear Finite Element Analysis of the rubber printing-pad led to a method
for pre-distorting artwork so that it would print undistorted on a curved product.
A flexible, more automated printer was developed that achieves a higher printing rate.
Ultraviolet-cured inks with improved printability were developed.
The image normalisation/ error-signalling stage in inspection was proven
in isolation, as was the pattern recognition system.
