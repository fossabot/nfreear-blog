We're quite fortunate in Milton Keynes to have a variety of independent
Chinese and Asian restaurants serving more _genuine_ cuisine.
Here are some suggestions, and below you'll find a handy map:

* [Taipan][] in the theatre district, serves a great dim sum breakfast/brunch, roughly 12~2pm at the weekends. They also do enjoyable hot pot dishes in the evening;
* Another reliable source of a dim sum brunch is [Kam Tong Garden][] in Great Holm.
* [Planet Dosa][] are a recent find in Oldbrook. They do delicious _pancakes_ from southern India and Sri Lanka;

Some notes,

* [dim sum][] are bite-size dumplings and other food, typically served for breakfast, in [Canton][] and other parts of China. They're a bit like Spanish tapas. Don't be put off by the form-like menu that you'll typically use to order food. If in doubt, ask for a menu with photos too!
* [Chinese dumplings][] can be steamed, boiled, shallow fried or grilled, and filled with meat, seafood, vegetables and tofu. Wonton are small dumplings served in soup;
* [congee][] is a Chinese porridge made from rice, and often containing preserved egg and meat, or served with side dishes;
* [dosa][] are a "_kind of pancake made from a fermented batter. Its main ingredients are rice and urad beans_ [black lentils]."
