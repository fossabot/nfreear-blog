I was in a meeting today of The Open University's accessibility practitioner's group.
Louise Olney, a project manager in Learning and Teaching Solutions kindly came to talk
to us about _OU Annotate_, and in particular the work that is being done to improve it's accessibility.

> "OU Annotate enables you add your own annotations to web pages.
> You can create an annotation for an entire web page, like a bookmark, or you can select and highlight specific text.
> You can add comments and tags to your annotations and, if you wish, share them with others."

OU Annotate is I think somewhat similar to [Snip.ly][] and [Diigo][]
(though as I haven't used either of these, I could be wrong!)

Open University students and staff can install the [OU Annotate bookmarklet and view the manager via StudentHome][ou-an].
And you may also like to [view the lead developer, Jenny Gray's screencast][screen], and [Jenny's blog posts][jenny].

I've given the OU Annotate bookmarklet a try, and so far it looks impressive.
I'm particularly happy to see the functionality to export annotations in various formats, including to Google Docs - intriguing.
I would also welcome the option to publish an RSS/Atom feed of my personal annotations.
I'm a fairly heavy Delicious user. If it was possible to make annotations world readable (probably a big ask), or if anyone who self-registers for a [free Open University account][free] could use OU Annotate I'd consider switching.

Personally, I think that OU Annotate would be a great marketing tool for the OU.
