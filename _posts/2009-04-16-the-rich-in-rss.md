Last month my colleagues and I had a team "hackday" – an opportunity to work
together (we often work individually on projects) and rapidly develop some software
prototypes. We had a few ideas beforehand, did a brainstorm then got down to
business in [the Digilab][]. It was a general success – however, we aren't ready
to show the results just yet – I'll update when we do ;). [Richard][], [Juliette][],
[Patrick][] and [Will][] worked with Twitter. [Sam][] and I put together an event
feed aggregator, using [Yahoo Pipes][].

We used [RememberTheMilk][] and [Google Calendar][] feeds as examples, and I was
struck again - why don't people use existing standards? Specifically, why don't
the feeds provided by RTM and Google use the [RSS 1.0 Event module][event]? What
they do is markup (or not) the data for the event (start date, location etc.) in
HTML, in [RSS][] or [Atom][]. So, for RememberTheMilk we have,


{% highlight xml %}
<entry>
  ...
  <id>tag:rememberthemilk.com,1999:tasks-nfre ...</id>
  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="">
    <div class="rtm_due"><span class="rtm_due_title">Due: </span>
        <span class="rtm_due_value">Thu 10 Apr 08 at 10:00AM</span></div>
    <div class="rtm_priority"><span class="rtm_priority_title">Priority: </span>
        <span class="rtm_due_value">none</span></div>
    ...
{% endhighlight %}


And for Google Calendar,


{% highlight xml %}
<entry xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
  <id>http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/d4 ... </id>
  <published>2009-02-18T18:08:04.000Z</published>
  <category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#event"/>
  <title type="html">Quick ...</title>
  <summary type="html">
   When: Wed 18 Feb 2009 18:00 to 18:15 GMT<br>
   <br>Event Status: confirmed
  </summary>
  <author><name>Sam ...</name></author>
...
{% endhighlight %}

Now, the examples above are useful for consumption by humans in a feed reader.
However, they are a pain to machine-parse. The HTML 'divs' in RTM are easier, but
you have to do something special for each calendar provider
(regular expressions for Google, yuck!)

The [RSS 1.0 Event module][event] was published in 2001. It defines the elements
`startdate`, `enddate` ([W3CDTF][]), `location`, `organizer` (person or body) and `type` (_fixed taxonomy ??_).
So the Google Calendar entry above becomes something like,


{% highlight xml %}
<entry xmlns="..." xmlns:ev="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/">
  <id>http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/d4 ... </id>
  <published>2009-02-18T18:08:04.000Z
  <category scheme="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" term="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#event"/>
  <title type="html">Quick ...</title>
  <ev:startdate>2009-02-18T18:00+00:00</ev:startdate>
  <ev:enddate>2009-02-18T18:15+00:00</ev:enddate>
  <ev:location> ... </ev:location>
  <ev:organizer>Sam ...</ev:organizer>
  <summary type="html">
   When: Wed 18 Feb 2009 18:00 to 18:15 GMT <br>
   <br>Event Status: confirmed
  </summary>
  <author><name>Sam ...</name></author>
...
{% endhighlight %}


So now we have data that is easily accessible to humans (via generic feed readers),
and to machines (specialist event parsers) - simple? _(The code samples above are
cut-down for illustration purposes.) [26 March, 3 April]_
