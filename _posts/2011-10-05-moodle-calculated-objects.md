  How do you set the problem up? I loaded the plugin but can't figure out the question setup?
  Is there a place I can find this?

Over the past 12 months I've created a number of contributed plugins for Moodle.
[Moodle][] is an open-source e-learning or virtual learning environment (VLE), that
teachers, lectures and trainers can use to enhance face-to-face and blended teaching.
It is also used by a number of large institutions like The Open University for distance education.

The first one I'll talk about is [Calculated Objects][plugin], a Moodle question type plugin.
It extends the quiz activity module and allows teachers to create questions like


{% highlight bash %}
    How much is {apples} + {oranges}?
{% endhighlight %}


The `{wildcards}`, which are taken from a fixed list are replaced with M and N images of apples and oranges respectively.
It is aimed at pre/primary-school (elementary school) children (approximately aged 3-9).

The code is available via the [new plugins database][plugin] and Github -- under the [GNU General Public License][gpl].
It now supports Moodle 1.9 and 2.0, and there is a French language pack (corrections welcome!) Moodle 2.1 is on my todo list.

There has been some great [discussion and feedback on the Moodle forums][forum] -- thanks all!

Find out more on the [Wiki page][] and in the [Readme][].
