In response to a recent [webinar on Accessibility & OER][event], I thought I'd
put together a list of some OER-like resources that I know of about accessibility.
Please feel free to tell me about resources that you've found useful!


### Web accessibility basics

* URL: <http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/concepts/accessibility>
* Type: wiki, online
* Publisher: Web Platform Docs
* License: CC-by-3.0 | <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/> |
  <http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Copyright>
* Notes: Web Platform is a collaborative documentation project sponsored by lots
  of top bodies including W3C, Adobe, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla and Opera.


### Dive Into Accessibility

* URL: http://diveintoaccessibility.info
* Type: book, print + online
* Copyright: Copyright © 2002 Mark Pilgrim
* License: GNU FDL | <http://gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html> |
  <http://diveintoaccessibility.info/terms_of_use.html>
* Notes: aimed primarily at developers and Web designers, but a good introduction
  for all. It uses fictional users with various (dis-)abilities to illustrate
  specific techniques - a very useful technique.
  Mark Pilgrim is a very readable technical author. An oldie but definitely a goldie!
