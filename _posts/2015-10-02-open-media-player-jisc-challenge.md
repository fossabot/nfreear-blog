<!--[![Vote! Jisc][jisc-icon]][jisc]-->

Today we entered our idea in Jisc's Accessible by Design competition. We've got some
innovations we'd like us to pursue, and Jisc's competition seems like a great vehicle.

We're looking at two features. The first is _interactive synchronized transcripts_.
This should be of benefit to those with hearing impairments, and a general audience.
In an e-learning context, interactive transcripts may be of benefit to anyone
who is time-poor, and quickly wants to recap specific parts of a online lecture or talk.
User's will be able to do a text search and jump to that point in the audio and video.
The current word or phrase will also be highlighted as the media is played.

The second is _audio description_ (AD), sometimes called _described video_. This is
important for the blind and visually impaired. Its fairly established on TV, but
not at all common on the Web (only the BBC in the UK I think). I envisage using
a separate audio track for the descriptions --
a challenge then becomes synchronizing the buffering of the video and audio.

A third thing (sort of a feature?) that is long-overdue is a general refresh of
the Player's visual design or theme. This is a good opportunity to improve usability
-- based on what we've learnt previously. It's also important to keep the Player
looking modern and attractive, so that authors want to embed it (there's no point
having a beautifully accessible player, that looks a bit "old" and clunky).

We're excited about the potential for these innovations.
Please show your support by voting on the Jisc Elevator web site.

Also take some to look at the other great ideas people have submitted.

Thank you!
