### Afternoon

I was happy to have lunch with Roger Wilson-Hinds and Natasha Beauharnais.
They are both involved with [Georgie Phone](http://www.georgiephone.com/),
a suite of low-cost Android mobile phone apps for the vision-impaired.
These look very promising – I must take a look. And, I think I've met Roger at previous events...

The afternoon started for me with setting up for the round-table discussion that
I was chairing, title "_OU Media Player: Mainstreaming video accessibility_".
My colleague, [Peter Devine](http://devine.co.uk/peter/), put a lot of work into an
[A0 poster][], that I hope the participants found useful.

I'm fairly used to giving presentations.
However, this was my first time chairing a discussion, and I was feeling nervous.
We had a good number of attendees for the discussion – between 9 and 11.
People attended from a wide variety of organizations, including the RNIB, the
[University of Southampton][soton], and the [Worshipful Co of Information Technologists][wcit].

Here are some of the questions that were asked and discussed:

* Did I have documentation on how to make a media player accessible? (Answer: not yet)
* How had we made the player accessible? (Answer: heavily customized [MediaElement.js][] + testing + iterate...)
* What formats/ file types did the player support? (Answer: generally those formats supported natively by browsers - via HTML 5; and those supported by Flash. So: mp3 audio, mp4, m4v and FLV video)
* Did it support, eg. YouTube/Vimeo? (Answer: the underlying [MediaElement.js] framework does support YouTube; OU Media Player doesn't yet – watch this space)
* Was it going to be open sourced? (Answer: yes)
* When? (Answer: at the time of the conference I couldn't say. Now I can say, within the next 6 months)
* What about DRM? (Answer: not considered yet. )

What I learnt about chairing a panel:

  * Have ideas jotted down for things to discuss - if there is a lull in conversation (I found there was a lull, and I wasn't quite prepared for it)
  * Be prepared to drive or guide things;
  * Try to include everyone, not just the most vocal (not sure I managed that);
  * Find a way to take notes;
  * Do a "register" at the start, so that you have everyone's contact details (should be obvious);
  * Go round at the start asking people to introduce themselves, explain what they
  want from the discussion (I think I did this – not sure how well though);
  * Hand out "feedback questionnaires" (meant to print some, ran out of time);

Thank you to all who attended the discussion.
And, thank you to the event organisers, Dan Jellinek and his team.
