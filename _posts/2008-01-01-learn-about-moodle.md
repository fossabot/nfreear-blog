> The word Moodle is an acronym for Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment.
> It's a free, open source tool designed to help educators create online learning
resources for students.
> In other words, it's a course managment system.
> Moodle is one of a number of systems that fall into the category of learning
management systems (LMS) or virtual learning environments (VLE) because it
provides a set of learning tools and resources to help build online courses or elearning.

## Who’s doing it?

Moodle was created by Martin Dougiamas following his experience as an Australian
university system administrator, and he remains the lead developer.
As Moodle is an open source tool it is being actively developed by a number
of people around the world.
One of this number is The Open University, which through the OUVLE project is
building a Moodle installation for 200,000 users. OpenLearn uses Moodle too.

There are a number of other commercial and open source VLE systems in the
marketplace that are direct competitors to Moodle.
These include Blackboard, Scholar360, WebCT, Desire2Learn, Fle3, Dokeos, .LRN,
Edumate, Sakai Project, LON- CAPA, Bodington, ILIAS and OLAT to name but a few.

## How does it work?

Moodle uses a programming language called PHP and a single database, which can be one of a number of relational database although MySQL or PostgreSQL are the most popular. The system runs on a server and is accessed using a web browser. Moodle provides methods to edit and display content to allow educators to create content quickly and easily. Also provided is a set of core functions such as course resources, course calendar, quizzes, forums, news and so forth. It also has an extensible range of modules that work on top of the core to extend it; for example to allow Adobe Flash content to be created and viewed through Moodle.

## Why is it significant?

Moodle is based on a constructivist approach to learning.
This gives users the ability to manipulate resources in ways unlike other VLEs,
which tend to be more rigid in their design and are based more on
'pushing content to learners' rather than engaging them.
Moodle has a suite of collaborative tools that enable this process.

Moodle is significant because it will create an environment that will
engage and challenge learners.
It will also provide pedagogical aspects that are currently missing from many
other elearning or VLE platforms.
