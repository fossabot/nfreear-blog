## [Machine vision for quality control of intelligent pad printing][bl-1998-freear]

Transfer pad printing is a widely used, robust decorating technique, ideal for
the curved forms of modern consumer products.
The paper presents progress in controlling the printing system, thus extending
its usefulness, using direct sensing and on-line Machine vision inspection.
The system centrels around global templae-matching to reveal the extent and
position of graphic defects, and Pattern recognition to distinguish between different defects and causes.
Local template-matching, active vision (lens zoom and camera rotation),
illumination and prepration of the graphic template support the core techniques.

pg.46--50.

## [Implementing intelligent visual inspection for pad printing][bl-1999-freear]

A key component of the _Intelpadprint_ project is a real-time visual inspection
and control system for pad printing, and the current _pre-prototype_ and future
demonstration implementations of this system are discussed here.
Communication with the pad printer is achieved using CAN-bus which will read
sensors and pass instructions from a software control object wihch also uses
fault classification data.
Recognition of print faults has been achieved using a two-stage
Linear Classification Algorithm (LCA) which is quite successful, but to improve
performance on noisy images neural networks have been evaluated for each stage of the LCA.
The software is a novel high-speed extension of machine vission and pattern
recognition, for which faults are extracted from the image of the graphic using template matching.
A _demonstration_ application is being developed, using the Component Object Model (COM),
with the safety critical CAN on an industrial PC and image processing objects
on a high-speed server.
