After a busy, rewarding and challenging year,
[Paco][] launched the main trial for [ADMINS][] on the 18th November 2020.
It was closed on the 10th January 2021, with 134 student respondents completing all parts of the trial.

A key takeaway from the research was that respondents preferred the ADMINS Chat-bot they trialled
over the existing online form, when disclosing their disabilities and needs to us.

[Chetz Colwell][chetz] undertook accessibility testing before our main trial, and
I've followed up by contributing [accessibility bug reports][bug] and [fixes][pr]
to the Microsoft _WebChat_ Javascript library.

Below I've summarised some of our technical achievements and some challenges we faced.

## Technical achievements

* [Richard][rich] developed a structured data-format to load the conversation into the Chat-bot.
  This gives us flexibility to customize the conversation-flow, without changing the code;

We developed …:

* A custom "_patient_", adaptive speech recognizer for the Chat-bot,
  built on [MS Speech][] Cognitive Services (_live-demoed_!);

* And, a [LUIS model][] to classify multiple disabilities and health conditions
  from a potentially long, multi-sentence disclosure by a student.

## Challenges

* Incomplete documentation; documentation only dealing with simpler use-cases; out-of-date documentation;

* Issues encountered with speech-to-text accuracy when using low bandwidth phone calls ([Paul][])

_I'm very proud of what we achieved throughout 2019-2020, and the COVID crisis!_

Thanks to :~ [Tim][], [Kate][], [Paco][], [Wayne][], [Jo][],
[Kevin][], [Peter][], [Rich][], [Paul][] and our consultant students.
